# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Your app was working, but users were losing their data (questionnaire, goals, etc.) every time they logged out and back in. This happened because:

1. **Aggressive Data Clearing**: The logout function was clearing ALL user data including questionnaire and goals
2. **No Data Restoration**: When users logged back in, the app created a new user instead of restoring their existing data
3. **Lost Onboarding State**: Users had to complete onboarding again after every logout

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Separated Session vs User Data Clearing**
- **`clearUserData()`**: Only for account deletion - clears everything
- **`clearSessionData()`**: For logout - only clears session (auth tokens, credentials)
- **Preserves**: Questionnaire data, goals, notes, calendar tasks, progress

### 2. **Smart User Restoration**
- **Login**: Checks for existing user data before creating new account
- **Registration**: Restores existing users instead of creating duplicates
- **Data Detection**: Looks for questionnaire and goals data to determine if user exists

### 3. **Improved Onboarding State Management**
- **Existing Users**: Automatically marked as onboarding complete if they have data
- **New Users**: Still go through onboarding process
- **Persistent State**: Onboarding status preserved across sessions

## How It Works Now

### Login Flow
1. **Try Supabase** (if configured) → **Try Django** (if configured) → **Check Local Data**
2. **If user has existing data**: Restore account with `isOnboardingComplete: true`
3. **If no existing data**: Use mock authentication
4. **Preserve all user data** during session changes

### Logout Flow
1. **Clear only session data** (tokens, credentials)
2. **Preserve user data** (questionnaire, goals, notes, etc.)
3. **User can log back in** and continue where they left off

### Registration Flow
1. **Check for existing data** first
2. **If data exists**: Restore account instead of creating new one
3. **If no data**: Create new account with onboarding

## Benefits

✅ **Data Persistence**: User data survives logout/login cycles
✅ **No Re-onboarding**: Users don't have to complete questionnaire again
✅ **Seamless Experience**: Users can log out and back in without losing progress
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing users get their data restored
✅ **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects returning users

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Complete onboarding** with questionnaire
2. **Logout** from the app
3. **Login again** with the same credentials
4. **Verify**: You should be logged in directly (no onboarding) with all your data intact

## Technical Details

### New Methods Added
- `clearSessionData()`: Clears only session-related data
- Enhanced login/registration logic to check for existing data
- Smart user restoration based on stored data

### Data Keys Preserved
- `questionnaire_{email}`: User's questionnaire responses
- `goals_{email}`: User's goals and habits
- `notes_{email}`: User's notes and journal entries
- `calendarTasks_{email}`: User's calendar and tasks
- `dailyProgress_{email}`: User's daily progress data

### Data Keys Cleared on Logout
- `rise_user`: Current user session
- `rise_token`: Authentication token
- `rise_credentials`: Stored credentials

## Status: ✅ FIXED

Your authentication system now properly preserves user data across logout/login cycles while maintaining security by clearing session data.
